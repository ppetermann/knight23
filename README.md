# Knight23

Knight23 is supposed be a small framework to build command line tools. 
Right now its in its infancy and not worth using. As this might not be 
clear enough, here again, in clear: 
**DO NOT USE THIS YET, IT WILL CHANGE AND BREAK THINGS**

## Manual
  1. use knight23/skeleton to start your cli tool project OR add 
  knight23/core to your project, and create the required files yourself 
  (hint: create an new project with skeleton, and copy over what you 
  need)

 2. make sure you register the default services required, as well as 
 add those that your code needs
 
 3. make a bin/<yourscript> file, which contains the runner as well
 as loads the commands of your application
 
## Support
at the moment there is no support. If you find bugs, problems, or have
suggestions feel free to use github to make a ticket, but don't expect
any fast answer.

## Features
you might not have understood the state of the project yet 
this is not to be used yet! Features **WILL** change.
